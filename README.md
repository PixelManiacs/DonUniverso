# Don Universo

Don Universo is a game project initiated by the [Pixel Maniacs](https://twitter.com/pixel_maniacs) during a gamejam called "[beansjam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/beansjam)" by German Gaming TV channel [RocketBeans.tv](https://www.rocketbeans.tv):

We would love to see that the game is futher developed but currently don't have the time and budget to finish it by ourselves.

So we've made the decision to make the current version of the game Open Source.
In case we publish it, 100% of the money will be donated to charity.
Which organisation shall receive the money is defined by all contributors of this project.

# Organisational Stuff

## Communication

We have created a channel in our Discord for contributors of the game:

## Pull Requests

If somebody else want's to do this job, simply contact him :)

# Possible Ways of Generating Revenue for Charity

## Steam

The game is submitted to Greenlight:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=930493851
It has 221 votes so far, so there is a (low-medium) chance we might get it Greenlit.

## iOS

I [(Ben)](https://twitter.com/blochmann) see a high Potential in bringing the game to Mobile, as we have a lot of experience here & could market it a bit (for free of course)
The tricky part would be the controls & performance on mobile.

## Android

Same as iOS :)

# Some other ideas

If we get some contributions here we could e.g. make a small show with all contributors via Skype on our [Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/pixel_maniacs) where
we discuss the current feature-requests or present how much revenue we've sent to charity so far etc.

# You think we're doing it wrong?

We want this project to generate the most possible revenue for charity.

In case we're doing anything wrong or have any recommendations, [contact us](https://twitter.com/pixel_maniacs).

If you think you're able to publish it better than we do, feel free to do so! :)
We still of course would tweet about the project or contribute some free ads in our mobile apps
