# About the Game

Don Universo is a game project initiated by the Pixel Maniacs during a gamejam called "beansjam" by German Gaming TV channel RocketBeans.tv:

We would love to see that the game is futher developed but currently don't have the time and budget to finish it by ourselves.

So we've made the decision to make the current version of the game Open Source.
In case we publish it, 100% of the money will be donated to charity.
Which organisation shall receive the money is defined by all contributors of this project.
