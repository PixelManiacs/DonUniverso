# Don Universo

Don Universo is a game project initiated by the [Pixel Maniacs](https://twitter.com/pixel_maniacs) during a gamejam called "[beansjam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/beansjam)" by German Gaming TV channel [Rocket Beans TV](https://www.rocketbeans.tv):

We would love to see the game being futher developed, but currently don't have the time and budget to finish it ourselves.

So we've made the decision to make the current version of the game Open Source.
In case we publish it, 100% of the money will be donated to charity.
Which organisation shall receive the money will be decided by contributors.

## Ideas for contribution

DonUniverso has been built on a weekend. The code is probably a mess, except it works :)
Some initial ideas for contributions:

- coding style and linting: brace style, method/property accessibility etc.
- typos
- replace GameObject.Find() calls
- spawn enemies closer to planet
- comments

# Options to generate Revenue for Charity

## Steam

The game has been submitted to Greenlight:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=930493851
It has 236 votes so far, so there is a (low) chance we might get it geenlit. I guess we need around 2,000 votes to get it greenlit.

## iOS

I [(Ben)](https://twitter.com/blochmann) see a high potential in bringing the game to mobile, since we have a lot of experience here and could market it a bit (for free of course).
The tricky part would be the controls and performance optimization on mobile.

## Android

Same as iOS :)

# Some other ideas

If we get some contributions here we could e.g. make a small show with all contributors via Skype in our [Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/pixel_maniacs) where
we discuss the current feature-requests or present how much revenue we've donated to charity so far etc.

# You think we're doing it wrong?

We want this project to generate the most possible revenue for charity.

In case we're doing anything wrong or have any recommendations, [contact us](https://twitter.com/pixel_maniacs).

Feel free to publish your own fork. However, if you do so, we'd love to see you dontate the revenue aswell :)
We still of course would tweet about the project or contribute some free ads in our mobile apps.
